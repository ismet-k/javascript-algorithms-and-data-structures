# JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification

This repository contains a collection of projects I completed while earning a certificate in JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures. Throughout the certification program, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions. I also applied my knowledge to create algorithms for various tasks, such as string manipulation, numeral conversion. Additionally, I gained an understanding of two important programming styles: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).
### Certificate

I successfully completed the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures certification program offered by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
